### What is TCSpawner?

TCSpawner is a mod for ProjectZomboid that spawns a specific set of items. I got the idea to start working on it after using NecroForge. After working on it and getting it working as a first release and version, I decided to turn it into a full fledge mod for ProjectZomboid instead of just some personal solo play through spawner.

### Features

- NumPad 1: Gives the player a stone hammer, stone axe, sledge hammer, saw, and box of nails.
- NumPad 2: Gives the player needle and thread.
- NumPad 3: Gives the player a duffelbag
- NumPad 4: Gives the player a padlock and the 'How to use a generator' magazine.

### What is TCSpawner?

I use this mod while developing other mods to make sure my items work when spawned via TCSpawner, it is recommended that you do not use this mod unless you want to cheat items in from my mods. The only items that get spawned in are items from my mods [and for now just a few items from the base game].

### Features

- NumPad 1: Gives the player a custom duffelbag
- NumPad 2: Gives the player a generator and a "How to use the generator" magazine
- NumPad 3: Gives the player a gas can
- NumPad 4: Gives the player a box of nails
- NumPad 5: Gives the player a custom stone axe, hunting knife, hammer, sledgehammer, screwdriver, and a saw from the base game
- NumPad 6: Gives the player a custom shovel
